don't plan on adding age and gender since they seem pretty superfluous at this point

need to deal with server-side validation of location and phone no (regex'es didn't work when I simply copied from front-end)

html geolocation is not accurate at all

fix active page as it appears on the navbar (has to be colored blue)

add regexes in the backend for item addition

making an api call for each item card is way too bad

api calls to get user address should be done on registration and added to database instead of being calculated for each item

add "delivered date" to user order history table 

move category info items into their own columns (admin view categories)

add eager loading and avoid n+1 problem

if an admin creates a category and then you delete the admin, there will be problems when viewing the category (due to added_by now returning null or undefined or whatever)
